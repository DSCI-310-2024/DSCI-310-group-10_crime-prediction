# Predict and Classify the appearance of criminal incidents based on historical incident reports (specifically 2023)

Authors: Cassandra Zhang, Ethan Kenny, James He, Pragya Singhal

Short Summary: \
Law enforcement agencies worldwide prioritize crime prevention and public safety, traditionally relying on experience and intuition for resource allocation. However, advancements in data analysis now enable a more data-driven approach. This analysis aims to investigate the correlation between crime rates and different times of day using 2023 police reports from San Francisco. Understanding time-related crime patterns can inform proactive policing strategies. By categorizing time periods as having high or low crime rates, this study aims to provide a forecasting tool for police patrol scheduling and resource allocation, ultimately enhancing law enforcement activities and public safety.
